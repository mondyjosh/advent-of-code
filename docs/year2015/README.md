# Advent of Code 2015 - C#

These are the challenges and inputs for [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015). I solved the challenges for AoC 2015 with a C# console application.

## How to run the project

You can run `AdventOfCode.csproj` with the targeted `year` and `day` to get both parts of that day's challenge.
