# Advent of Code 2022 - Rust

These are the challenges and inputs for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I solved the challenges for AoC 2022 with a Rust console application.

## How to run the project

~~You can run `AdventOfCode.csproj` with the targeted `year` and `day` to get both parts of that day's challenge.~~

TBD. I'm trying to figure out how to set up my Rust project to use TDD and a solutions library that the Rust binary app can load and run. Early days!
